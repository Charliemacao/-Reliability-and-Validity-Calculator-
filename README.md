The Reliability and Validity Calculator is a comprehensive tool designed to compute key metrics for assessing the reliability and validity of measurement instruments. It can calculate:

Factor Loading: Measures the correlation between observed variables and their underlying latent factors.
Average Variance Extracted (AVE): Assesses the amount of variance captured by a construct in relation to the amount of variance due to measurement error.
Composite Reliability (CR): Evaluates the internal consistency of a set of items forming a latent construct.
Cronbach's Alpha: Provides an estimate of the reliability of a psychometric test.
Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio (HTMT): Assesses discriminant validity by comparing the ratio of between-trait correlations to within-trait correlations.
This calculator is essential for researchers and practitioners who need to ensure the accuracy and consistency of their measurement tools.
